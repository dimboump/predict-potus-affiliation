# Predict POTUS affiliation

All the code for the Machine Learning II assignment (MA DTA 2021).

## Main idea

Use famous speeches delivered by US Presidents and train 3 machine learning and 3 deep learning models to classify them in a political party (Democratic or Republican).

## Dependencies

The code depends on the following third-party libraries:

- `NumPy`
- `Pandas`
- `Matplotlib`
- `Scikit-Learn`
- `Tensorflow` and `Keras`

## Models

### Machine learning

- Stohastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Random Forest (RF)
