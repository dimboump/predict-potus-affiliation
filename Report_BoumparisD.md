# Predicting POTUS Affiliation with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow

## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Overview

The report at hand aims at briefly outlining the main differences found in the results of 6 different algorithm implementations on textual data. The objective of these experiments was to analyze how 3 Machine Learning and 3 Deep Learning algorithms perform on the text classification task by using the Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow Keras libraries respectively. The task at hand is to train these algorithms to predict whether a speech (in written form) belongs to a Democratic or Republican President of the United States (POTUS).

The algorithms used are:

* Machine Learning (`Scikit-Learn`):
  * Logistic Regression
  * Support Vector Machines
  * k Nearest Neighbors
* Deep Learning (`TensorFlow Keras`):
  * Dense Neural Network
  * Simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
  * Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network
